/**
 * Exact decimal arithmetic for XLM amounts (issue #178).
 *
 * Stellar amounts are integers of stroops: one XLM is exactly 10,000,000
 * stroops, and nothing finer exists. Representing them as JavaScript numbers
 * means representing decimal fractions in binary floating point, where `0.1`
 * and `0.2` are both approximations and `0.1 + 0.2` is `0.30000000000000004` —
 * strictly greater than `0.3`. A policy that compares a running total against a
 * cap in floating point therefore refuses payments that land exactly on the cap.
 *
 * Every amount that participates in a limit decision is converted to a `bigint`
 * count of stroops first, so the comparison is integer arithmetic and the drift
 * cannot occur.
